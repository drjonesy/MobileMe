# MobileMe
A simple jQuery HTML app for viewing user input text on top of an image. Allows for the user to change the font style and text color.

- Uses jQuery
- All JavaScript functions happen in the functions.js file
- The style sheet imports google fonts and is used to manipulate the displayed text and color of the displayed text, it also is used to set the background image. This could be easily swapped with an <img> tag and using z-index values.
